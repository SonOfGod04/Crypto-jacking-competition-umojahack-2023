# Crypto-jacking-competition-umojahack-2023
I actively participated in the "Cryptojacking Detection Challenge" during the recent hackathon. The challenge revolved around addressing the issue of cryptojacking, a nefarious cyber-attack that covertly harnesses users' computational resources to mine cryptocurrency without their consent. These attacks often mimic legitimate cryptocurrency mining operations, making them difficult to identify and analyze. The consequences of cryptojacking can be profound, leading to a noticeable decrease in computing performance and potential system crashes.

Objective:

Our primary goal in this hackathon project was to develop an efficient system for classifying network activity originating from various websites. This classification entailed distinguishing between instances of cryptojacking and benign network activity. To achieve this, we leveraged an array of features derived from both network-based and host-based data. The ultimate objective was to create a robust model capable of automatically identifying and flagging cryptojacking activities, thereby enhancing cybersecurity and safeguarding the computational resources of users.

Through collaborative efforts and innovative problem-solving, our team made significant strides in addressing this critical challenge. We harnessed data science, machine learning, and cybersecurity expertise to develop a powerful cryptojacking detection model. Our participation in this hackathon was driven by the shared passion for cybersecurity and the desire to contribute to the protection of online users from covert cyber-attacks.

This experience allowed us to expand our knowledge and practical skills in data analysis, feature engineering, and model development within the cybersecurity domain. We are grateful for the opportunity to collaborate with talented individuals and work towards a common goal, reinforcing our commitment to cybersecurity excellence.

Our team's hard work and dedication in this hackathon not only enriched our skillset but also contributed to the broader community's understanding and defense against cryptojacking threats.

We look forward to further refining our project and continuing our efforts to combat cryptojacking in the future.
