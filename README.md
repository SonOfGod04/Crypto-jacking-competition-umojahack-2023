# Crypto-jacking-competition-umojahack-2023
Overview:

I actively participated in the "Cryptojacking Detection Challenge" during the recent hackathon. This challenge addressed the issue of cryptojacking, a cyber-attack that secretly utilizes users' computational resources to mine cryptocurrency without their consent. These attacks are challenging to identify and can lead to a decrease in computing performance and potential system crashes.

Objective:

Our primary goal in this project was to classify network activity from various websites, distinguishing between cryptojacking and benign activity. We used features from both network and host-based data to develop a model that identifies cryptojacking. Our team made significant progress in addressing this challenge by leveraging data science, machine learning, and cybersecurity expertise.

This hackathon experience enhanced our skills in data analysis, feature engineering, and cybersecurity. We are committed to continuing our efforts to combat cryptojacking in the future.
